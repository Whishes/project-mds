# Product Launch Page

## Description
You've just been messaged by a close friend asking for your help in creating a plain launch page for their eventual product/website. As the product/website name and launch date are currently unknown, you're welcome to use any placeholder name you see fit to use. 

### Notes:

 - Since your friend believes this page will be accessed by a wide variety of users you'll be required to have the page be suitable to view on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops at least.
 - You don't have to worry about maximum support for older browser versions but do keep features/code accessible across most "current" browsers (ie. Firefox, Safari, Chrome). 
 - As your friend isn't too fussed on the specific colours you're welcome to pick your own as long as you stick to your own theme (primary, primary variant, secondary colours etc). 
	 - for more info see: [here](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation)
- You're welcome to use anything you see fit to create this landing page (eg. React or vanilla JS, CSS, Tailwind, Material UI, Google Fonts etc) but do keep in mind that it's much harder to override CSS frameworks stylings to obtain something unique to yourself rather than just doing it yourself. So use them *wisely* if that's your decision.
